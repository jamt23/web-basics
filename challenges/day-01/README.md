For today's assignment, I want you to try and match the image below as closely as possible.

Here are a few requirements:
- The entire website needs to be in a single html file named `index.html`.
- No external CSS or JS can be used.
- No inline CSS can be used.
- The browser tab for this website should say "Day 01".
- The shapes should be 100px wide and 100px tall. (Do not use SVG or an image, make the block from a div)
- Site must be deployed on Github Pages. Update this Readme and add the link to the top.
