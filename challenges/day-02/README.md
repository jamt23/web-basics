## Day 02


**Date:** 12/22/2022  
**Site:** https://jamt23.github.io/web-basics/challenges/day-02/index.html


Let's start getting a little fancier with the css now. I want you to try and match the image below as
closely as possible.

Here are a few requirements:
- **Do this work on a new branch!** Make a PR when turning in.
- The entire website needs to be in a single html file named `index.html`.
- No external CSS or JS can be used.
- No inline CSS can be used.
- The browser tab for this website should say "Day 02".
- Use the image that was provided `./background.jpg`
- Site must be deployed on Github Pages. Update this Readme and add the link to the top.
- My CSS was only 20 lines, so try to keep yours brief (ie below 40 lines of CSS).
